1
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,240
You have no right to be here.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,260
The eviction order hasn't taken effect yet.

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,290
You have no right. You never had!

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,400
You never will!

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,380
It's clear he's taking the land for himself.

6
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,240
All power comes from God.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,310
As long as it suits Him, fear not.

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,350
And so, it suits Him?

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,370
The prosecutor is not here.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,200
I can't take your complaint.

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,430
Read this.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,270
And if I don't, what happens?

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,290
Nothing is impossible for you, right?

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I want Ms Sergeyev to have his due.

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,200
- I love you.
- I know.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,270
I have more interesting targets.

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,370
Any current Presidents?

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,390
Not enough historical perspective.

19
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,430
Who will bring us proof?

20
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,270
Do you believe in God?

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,230
So, where is your merciful God?

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,360
"Upon earth there is not his like."
