00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,300
ANDREl RUBLEV

2
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,530
Pull the rope.

3
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,539
This is one?

4
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,539
Arkhip, give me the strap.

5
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,539
Hold it.

6
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:43,669
Take it.

7
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,550
Look!

8
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,550
lt's Yefim, isn't it?

9
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,389
Come here and help.

10
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,629
Pull the rope.

11
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,520
Hold on a second.

12
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,520
Come on, quick!

13
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,520
Where is it?

14
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:21,639
Here.

15
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,530
Come on, fast.

16
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,530
Lift it.

17
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,370
-Lord. Let it go right.
-Untie it now.

18
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,490
The rope is tangled.

19
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,500
Hold it!

20
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,500
We won't have enough time.

21
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,379
l'm ready!

22
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,509
Archipushka! You try to
hold them!

23
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,389
Just a second.

24
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,509
Come on!

25
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:24,399
Hold him, hold him!

26
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:39,410
l'm here. l'm here.

27
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,660
Cut the rope, man!

28
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,420
Cut the rope!

29
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,420
l'll show you, cut the rope!

30
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,500
My God!

31
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,509
Yefim!

32
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,509
Where are you going?

33
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,509
Archipushka!

34
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,389
l'm flying! l'm flying!

35
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,360
Hey! Chase me! Chase me!

36
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,399
My God! What is it?

37
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:00,350
Archipushka!

38
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:05,990
THE JESTER
Summer 140O

39
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,610
Danil!

40
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,379
Danil! The father told you
to go back!

41
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,379
There is no one to paint
the icons.

42
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,500
For God's sake!

43
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,509
lt's no business of yours.

44
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:44,149
You will be sorry for that. You will
come begging on your knee's.

45
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,509
Come on. You never know.

46
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,509
We shall see.

47
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,460
lt's not good.

48
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,460
What?

49
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,460
That we are leaving Troitsa.

50
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,470
lt's a shame.

51
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,110
Aren't there enough painters in
Moscow without us, Danil?

52
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,360
We'll find some sort of work.

53
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,360
All this is right, but it's
a pity that...

54
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:28,250
l passed this birch every day
and never noticed it.

55
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:33,129
When you know you'll never see
it, again means something.

56
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:37,250
lt's been ten years. Nine for
you, but ten for me.

57
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,379
No, seven for me
nine for you.

58
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,500
-lt's raining.
-Come on here.

59
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,509
Let's go. We will not melt.

60
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,309
The jesters were walking. Drunk
on mead and beer...

61
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,429
when they met their master,
the Boyar...

62
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,549
and they sang, to greet him:

63
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,559
O master. O Boyar...

64
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,440
everything is ready in
the kitchen!

65
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,320
The Boyar's plump wife
is a choosy trollop.

66
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,210
Mistress, open the door.
The master's coming!

67
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,149
The Boyar yells: ''Jesters are all
thieves and drunkards!''

68
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:02,269
''You should be whipped from
Friday to Friday!''

69
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,279
''You goats and tramps, drown
in your beer!''

70
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,399
''Soon you will be impaled!''

71
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,169
The Jesters grabbed him between
his navel and his knees.

72
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,169
They shaved his beard; what's a
Boyar without his beard?

73
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,299
Any woman would rather
he had a beard.

74
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,299
The Boyar yells, hops
about like a flea.

75
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,309
He scurries home, raps
on the window.

76
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,200
But his wife doesn't recognize
his naked cheeks...

77
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,440
with no beard to grab hold of.

78
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,440
She whacked him with
a rolling pin.

79
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,379
What a disgrace!

80
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,269
''Cover your naked cheeks
with your breeches.''

81
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,509
''Clear off, beardless Boyar!''

82
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,399
He hobbled off, pursued
by geese...

83
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,399
and meet a priest...

84
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,039
who mistook him for a woman and
dragged him into the bushes.

85
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,169
Without breeches...
he looks the same at each end.

86
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,379
The woman saw a naked head...

87
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,379
and grabbed it by the beard.

88
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,399
May we shelter from the storm?

89
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,639
Come in.

90
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,289
Do you want some beer?
You are soaking wet.

91
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,529
Thank you, we don't imbibe.

92
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,539
And don't play around with women.

93
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,289
God sent priests, but the
devil sent jesters.

94
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,500
The woman saw a head!

95
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,379
By the beard!

96
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,279
My woman might have been
playing in the bushes.

97
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,529
l'll show you!

98
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,349
Come here, you.

99
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,509
What are you doing?

100
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:18,480
Give it back to him.

101
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,500
Where were you, Kirill?

102
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,500
Outside. Shall we go?

103
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,269
Danil, the rain's stopped;
Iet's go.

104
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,430
Christ be with you, mistress.

105
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:30,930
THEOPHANES THE GREEK
Summer-Winter-Spring-Summer-1405-1406

106
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,549
l'm innocent!

107
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,509
Let me go!

108
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,539
ls anyone in here?

109
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:09,509
Have you come to look?

110
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,509
Yes, to look.

111
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:23,400
Then look. We'll soon be finished.

112
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:29,289
So you are Theophanes the Greek?

113
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,410
Why look at me? Look there.

114
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,539
Where are you from?

115
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,420
From Andronnikov Monastery.

116
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,299
From Andronnikov Monastery? Are you
by chance Andrei Rublev?

117
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:50,670
No.

118
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:55,250
l've heard everyone praise
this Rublev.

119
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:01,250
He's good, but not as good as this.

120
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,380
Such delicate colors.

121
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:13,509
Oh Lord, it's just...

122
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:27,279
Why did you stop praising me?
Go on.

123
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:31,279
l can't. l can't find the
right words.

124
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:35,289
Konstantin Kostechevsky was
right when he said:

125
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:38,410
''Only with true insight...

126
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:41,410
can you grasp its essence.''

127
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,299
Whereas Andrei... and l'll
tell him to his face...

128
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,420
He's like my brother.

129
00:24:54,779 --> 00:25:00,869
He's praised, it's true: he paints
well. With subtlety.

130
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:05,369
But there's something Lacking
in all his work.

131
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,259
There's no awe, no faith...

132
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,380
no faith that comes from the
depths of his soul.

133
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,509
No simplicity.

134
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:26,150
As Epiphanius said in ''The Life of
Saint Sergeius'':

135
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,390
''Simplicity, without gaudiness.''

136
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:35,400
That is what this is. It's sacred.

137
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:41,160
Simplicity, without gaudiness...
you can't say it better.

138
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,529
l see you are a wise man.

139
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:45,529
lf so, is that a good thing?

140
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:50,170
lf one is ignorant, isn't it better
to be guided by one's heart?

141
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,240
ln much wisdom there
is much grief...

142
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:59,240
And he who increases knowledge
increases sorrow.

143
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:09,369
Proshka! Where is that oil?

144
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:12,490
Whose ears should l box?

145
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,490
lt is as though the earth has
swallowed everyone.

146
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,369
They say you paint quickly.

147
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,380
l cannot work any other way.
l got bored.

148
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,259
l wasted a week on an icon once.

149
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,500
You threw it away?

150
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:28,509
No. l used the board to
press cabbage.

151
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:32,390
lt's all so boring.

152
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:34,509
l have pupils and assistants
in abundance...

153
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,509
But none of them is any good.

154
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,519
They can neither red nor write.

155
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:44,400
Listen, help me. Be my assistant.

156
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:49,529
Don't make fun of me.

157
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,529
l'm not making fun of you.

158
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:54,349
ln spring, l must paint the Church of
the Annunciation in Moscow...

159
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:57,349
and l have no assistants
to do it with.

160
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:59,470
The scaffolding is being built.

161
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,470
-Do you understand?
-l do understand.

162
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:02,599
But l wouldn't be able to cope.

163
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:04,480
l'll teach you. You never prepared
a wall for a fresco?

164
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:09,119
You've a brain; even these idiots
can prepare a wall.

165
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:14,119
l said no and l mean no.

166
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:17,369
You know best...

167
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:19,490
But mind you don't regret;
l am rancorous.

168
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,130
l may regret it, but it's
a sin for you.

169
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,259
An unknown monk comes to you...

170
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,380
and you like the fact that you can
talk about books with him...

171
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:35,269
and you decide to take him
and favor him.

172
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:38,390
But l haven't looked at a book for
three years and l don't want to.

173
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:41,390
-Why?
-l have a different road.

174
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,519
Wicked bastards!

175
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,519
Where is Proshka?
Where is Vikenty?

176
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:49,400
They ran to the square to see how
they were going to kill the ruler.

177
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:55,099
Wicked bastards!

178
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,460
See?

179
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,480
And you don't want to help?

180
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:13,480
-l shall die soon.
-You shouldn't say that.

181
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,369
The other night l dreamed
of an angel.

182
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,259
He said: ''Come with me.''

183
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,500
l said: ''l shall die soon
without you.''

184
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,259
You won't change your mind,
will you?

185
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:56,339
Only on one condition.

186
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:03,339
Whatever you want. Money?
Half my fee, okay?

187
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,220
No. l'll work for nothing if
you yourself...

188
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:13,109
Come to Andronnikov Monastery
to fetch me.

189
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:19,859
Before the community, the
metropolitan, ask me to help you...

190
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:26,869
Before the brotherhood
before Andrei Rublev.

191
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:32,250
Then l shall serve you
like a slave...

192
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:35,369
Like a dog, until the day l die.

193
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,500
What is your name?

194
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,500
Kirill.

195
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:53,150
Orthodox Christians
Iovers of truth.

196
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:55,509
How long will this torture go on,
when will...

197
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:56,640
you end this?

198
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:59,400
You are thoughtless sinners,
yet you judge.

199
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:06,400
You faithless heathens!

200
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:09,410
He has already seven times
atoned for his sins...

201
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:13,410
for both his sins and yours.

202
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:16,410
You are incredible
sinners yourselves.

203
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,420
And you judge... but you don't
have God with you.

204
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,390
Rejoice, o young man,
in thy youth...

205
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:04,150
and let thy heart cheer thee
in the days of thy youth.

206
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,279
Walk in the ways of the thine heart,
an in the sight of thine eyes...

207
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:16,039
but know that for all these...
God will bring thee into judgment.

208
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,420
Remember now thy Creator in
the days of thy youth...

209
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,420
before the difficult days come...

210
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,430
and the years draw nigh, when
thou shalt say...

211
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,549
''l have no pleasure in them.''

212
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:43,309
Remember thy Creator...

213
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,440
before the silver cord be loosed. Or
the golden bowl be broken...

214
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:48,559
or the pitcher shattered
at the fountain...

215
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,559
or the wheel broken at the well.

216
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:53,440
Then shall the dust return to the
earth as it was...

217
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,259
and the spirit shall return unto
God who gave it.

218
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,150
''Vanity of vanities,'' saith the
preacher; ''All is vanity.''

219
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,269
Kirill, have you seen
Father Nikodim?

220
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:15,400
Where has he got to since
this morning?

221
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:21,039
He took my gloves, then disappeared
as though the earth swallowed

222
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:26,170
l have to chop wood and
the logs are icy.

223
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,299
Why is your candle burning?
It's daylight.

224
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,539
Did you feed my dog?

225
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:41,549
Did you ask me to?

226
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:49,430
What's the matter with you?

227
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,500
Go away.

228
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,140
The words of the wise are like
goads, and the words of...

229
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,259
scholars are like well-driven nails
given by one Shepherd.

230
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:12,269
And further, my son, you should
stay away from these.

231
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:16,390
N making many books
there is no end...

232
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,519
and much study is wearisome
to the flesh.

233
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:21,400
Let us hear the conclusion of
the whole matter...

234
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:24,400
Fear God and keep His
commandments...

235
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:27,400
for this is man's all.

236
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:29,529
A messenger has come!

237
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:33,289
Who has come? A messenger from
Moscow has come.

238
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:37,410
A messenger has come from
the Grand Prince.

239
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,539
So?

240
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,539
So so.

241
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,420
A messenger from Theophanes
the Greek.

242
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:50,309
The Grand Prince orders
you to Moscow...

243
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:54,250
To paint the cathedral of the
Annunciation, with Theophanes.

244
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,369
ls he really Andrei Rublev,
this fellow?

245
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,260
Yes, he's Rublev... and l'm Kirill.

246
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:17,269
Theophanes the Greek says he
wants you in Moscow...

247
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,510
and he wishes to see you.

248
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,510
l thank Theophanes.

249
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,519
Tell him...

250
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,519
that l'll come.

251
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,519
l'll come.

252
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:37,409
My head is splitting!

253
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,530
Bring my horse here.

254
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,539
What is wrong?

255
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,119
Choose whichever helpers you like
and be ready tomorrow.

256
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,119
,
Is there a blacksmith here? If not
l'll fall off again.

257
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:04,369
There is a smithy outside,
beyond the chapel.

258
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:07,489
Farewell, God-fearing people!

259
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,500
Semyon! Come here!

260
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,500
Come here and help us!

261
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,380
Why are you standing?
Come here!

262
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,400
Let's go today, shall we,
Danil?

263
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:44,170
Go quickly, before Theophanes
changes his mind.

264
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:46,530
l'm not going.

265
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:48,530
Why aren't you going?

266
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:48,530
How can l manage without you?

267
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,360
As best you can.

268
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,360
l thought we'd go together.

269
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,239
Why did you think for me?
l was not invited.

270
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,489
l can't do it without you.

271
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,139
You can; you agreed to go
without asking me.

272
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,380
Theophanes simply beckoned.

273
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,269
Don't grieve; you're not
the first, or the last.

274
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:34,389
Even without you there's plenty
of work for me here.

275
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,519
Thank God for it.

276
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,409
Foma, Aleksei. Let's get ready.

277
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:51,530
Piotr, you're coming with me.

278
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:18,369
Did you forget something, Andrei?

279
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,489
l came to say farewell.

280
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,500
We've said farewell.

281
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:42,389
l came to say farewell, but...

282
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,400
it was hard for me before.

283
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:56,340
Then the devil created enmity
bettween us.

284
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,340
l can't go away like this.

285
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:03,469
l must make confession.

286
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:08,469
Will you hear it?

287
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,360
l cannot do anything, Danil...

288
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:26,250
After living so many years together
in the same cell.

289
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:33,130
Apart from you, l have on one.

290
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,380
l see the world with your eyes.

291
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:43,510
l hear it with your ears...

292
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,510
With your heart.

293
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,219
l am happy for you, you old fool.

294
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,340
lf only knew how happy.

295
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:09,230
Go to Moscow. Paint; l shall
be proud of you.

296
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:14,110
The devil tempted me the other
day too. Forgive me.

297
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,380
l'll come back, Danil.

298
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,400
Where are you going? What
about Vespers?

299
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,400
l'll manage without you.

300
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,400
What's wrong with you today,
Kirill?

301
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:11,289
l'm tired of lying. l'm going back
into the secular world.

302
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,409
Why did we leave the
Trinity Monastery?

303
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,420
Andrei, Danil, you are not
saying anything.

304
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,420
Because the brothers valued profit
higher than faith.

305
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,420
They forgot why they had entered
a monastery.

306
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,550
And now?

307
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:33,309
We sought to praise God with faith
and work, but what's happened?

308
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,429
The monastery's become a bazaar.

309
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,440
Servant of god, how many souls did
you trade in for monasticism?

310
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,559
Twenty or thirty?

311
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,320
And you ran after the Father
Superior, bargaining.

312
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:50,210
For ttwo meadows, or even one, you
bought eternal salvation.

313
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:56,030
You don't need me to tell you, but
you prefer to keep quiet.

314
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:02,030
Perhaps l would also tolerate all
this loathsomeness if l had talent.

315
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,280
But what talent? Just a slight
ability to paint icons.

316
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,159
God be praised that He
gave me no talent.

317
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,280
l'm happy l'm untalented; l can be
honest and pure before god.

318
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:17,530
You are taking sin upon
your soul!

319
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:20,409
l'll tell you something else,
brothers.

320
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:25,170
What to you want to tell us that
we don't l know already?

321
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,420
Do you know what happens to
your sort? Speak!

322
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,539
l won't get offended!

323
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,659
Well, l...

324
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,420
Get out, you dog!

325
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,190
Out of my sight, you serpent! Rejoin
the secular world, slanderer!

326
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:41,550
Now do you see?

327
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:42,670
Kirill!

328
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,559
Kirill!

329
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:07,150
lt is written: ''And Jesus went into
the temple of God...

330
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:11,269
and cast out all them that sold
and bought in the temple...

331
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,400
and overthrew the tables of
the money changers...

332
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,519
and the seats of them that
sold doves.''

333
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:22,039
,
''And said unto them,'' it is written
''My house shall be called...

334
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:27,170
the house of prayer; but ye have
made it a den of thieves.''

335
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,280
For three years l was cleaning
brushes for Danil...

336
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:31,530
Before he let me touch an icon.

337
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:33,530
And then only to clean it.

338
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:35,530
Don't you trust me?

339
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:38,409
You're always lying, Foma.

340
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,300
Yesterday your robe was sticky;
where were you?

341
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,659
At the beehive.

342
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,539
But you said you were at
the monastery.

343
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:49,550
Just look at yourself.

344
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,369
Put mud or something
on your cheek....

345
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:58,489
Or you will swell, like a hog.

346
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:01,369
lt's too late now, it's useless.

347
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,380
You're constantly making
up stories.

348
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,260
l even think you have a disease.

349
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:17,510
Me? What disease?

350
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:26,150
There is a disease where a man
lies without stopping.

351
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,530
Look, Foma.

352
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:40,530
Look, l say.

353
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,539
What?

354
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,420
You think know everything so l'm not
going to teach you any more.

355
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,360
Why should l learn?

356
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,360
Anyway, l will have to spend three
years cleaning the brushes.

357
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,480
l'm sick and tired of you,
Foma.

358
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:03,250
Go back to the monastery, go
wherever you want.

359
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,260
l can't understand why l took
you as a pupil.

360
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:24,389
You are always like that. First you
say one thing then another.

361
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:28,269
You yourself told Theophanes
l was perceptive.

362
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,269
You were different then; you
worked, you didn't lie.

363
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,280
And do you know what
Theophanes said?

364
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:41,530
''What does it matter it
he's perceptive?''

365
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:43,530
Whatever Theophanes has said...

366
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:45,530
l can see blue colors better
than anyone else.

367
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:45,530
You eat too much; how can you paint
with a bloated stomach?

368
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:57,239
When your stomach's rumbling, how
can your mind work?

369
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,360
The rumbling is the only
sound you hear.

370
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,239
You're lucky, Foma. For you,
everything is simple.

371
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,239
lf you are not painting, you are
sleeping or fooling around.

372
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:15,130
But only by prayer can the soul
transcend the flesh.

373
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,380
Would you go to learn from another
teacher instead of me?

374
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,380
Why not, it you tell me to go?

375
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,380
Come on, come on.
Don't be angry.

376
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:31,510
What's that?

377
00:46:57,769 --> 00:47:02,110
So you've decided to put the
apostle on the left, Andrei.

378
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,480
Did you take glue off the fire?

379
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,480
Did you take glue off the fire?

380
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:19,489
Perceptive is he?

381
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:24,250
He should be beaten every
Saturday, like a dog.

382
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:47,510
You're obstinate, Andrei.

383
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:52,150
How did you so much? Everyone else
is thinking only of himself.

384
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,460
l say it, Theophanes.

385
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,329
The women of Moscow gave their
hair to the Tatars.

386
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,340
What else could the poor
creatures do?

387
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,219
Better to lose their hair than be
tortured. Is that heroic?

388
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,579
lt is.

389
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:12,989
lt is true that Russian women are
humiliated and unhappy.

390
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:16,349
lt's not what l mean.

391
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,239
Tell me honestly, are the people
ignorant or not?

392
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,480
Well, are they?

393
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,360
They're ignorant, but whose
fault is that?

394
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:31,130
lt's their own stupidity. Have you
never sinned through ignorance?

395
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:33,489
Everyone has.

396
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:37,250
And l have too. God forgive us
and make us better.

397
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,500
Well, never mind.

398
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,139
The Last Judgment is coming;
we'll burn like candles.

399
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,380
Mark my words.

400
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:53,150
Each will accuse the other of his
own sins, to defend himself.

401
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:59,030
Theophanes, how can you paint with
such ideas, even accept praise?

402
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,159
l have become a hermit and
lived in a cave.

403
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,519
l serve God, not man.

404
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:14,050
As regards praise, what is praised
today is abused tomorrow.

405
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,179
They will forget you, me,
everything.

406
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,420
All is vanity and ashes. Worse
things have been forgotten.

407
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,420
Humanity has already committed
every stupidity and baseness....

408
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:30,550
and now it only repeats them.

409
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:35,309
Everything is an eternal circle and
it repeats and repeats itself.

410
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:40,190
lf Jesus returned to earth, they
would crucify him again.

411
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,440
N course, if only evil
is remembered....

412
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,440
then you will never be happy in
the sight of God.

413
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:51,210
Perhaps we must forget some
things; but not all.

414
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:55,389
l don't know how to say it.

415
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:57,510
Then be quiet and listen to me.

416
00:50:58,809 --> 00:50:59,630
So.

417
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:05,269
You think that one can only
do good alone?

418
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,280
Good. Remember the
New Testament.

419
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,400
Jesus taught people
in the temples...

420
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:19,050
so why did they gather later?
To kill him!

421
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:22,409
''Crucify him'' they shouted.

422
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,179
And the disciples? Judas sold Him.
Peter denied Him.

423
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,300
They all ran away, yet they
were the best.

424
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,539
But they repented.

425
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:38,309
That was afterwards, when
it was too late.

426
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,309
lt's never too late to repent.

427
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,380
N course, people do evil.

428
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:04,389
But you can not blame
them altogether.

429
00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:07,510
lt's difficult...

430
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:09,510
and sinful, l think.

431
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,280
Judas sold the Christ, and remember
who bought him.

432
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,519
People.

433
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,519
And who accused Jesus?

434
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,519
The scribes and Pharisees...

435
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:26,289
they could not find witnesses,
however hard they tried.

436
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:29,409
''Who will testify against
this innocent?''

437
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:32,409
Only later on they found
the traitors.

438
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,539
Two were found immediately.

439
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,539
Two, and not one.

440
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,539
There were only ttwo.

441
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:44,309
The Pharisees were masters
of deceit, educated.

442
00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:47,429
They had studied to gain power...

443
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:49,550
to take advantage of the
people's ignorance.

444
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:54,260
We must remind people more often
that they are people.

445
00:52:55,789 --> 00:52:58,369
,
Russians, of the same blood
of the same land.

446
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,500
Evil is everywhere.

447
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,260
Someone will always sell you for
thirty pieces of silver.

448
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:11,269
New misfortunes constantly
befall the peasant...

449
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:18,150
either Tatars three times an
autumn, or famine, or plague...

450
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,519
and he still keeps on working,
working, working...

451
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,519
meekly bearing his cross.

452
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,519
He does not despair, he is
silent and patient.

453
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,280
He only prays to God for
enough strength.

454
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:34,170
How could god not forgive
him his ignorance?

455
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,300
You know yourself. You're
tired and discouraged...

456
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,539
and suddenly...

457
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,300
in the crowd you meet a
human glance...

458
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:54,130
and everything's lighter, as it
is after Communion.

459
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:55,610
lsn't it so?

460
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:01,369
You just spoke of Jesus.

461
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:04,369
Perhaps He was born and
crucified to reconcile...

462
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,380
God and man.

463
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,380
Jesus came from God, so
He is all-powerful.

464
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,139
,
And if He died on the cross
it was predetermined...

465
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:20,150
and His crucifiKion and death
were God's will.

466
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:24,269
That would have aroused hatred
not in those who crucified Him...

467
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,519
but in those who loved Him...

468
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,400
if they had been near Him
at that moment...

469
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,280
because they loved Him
as a man only.

470
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:38,170
,
but if He, of His own will
Ieft them...

471
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:43,170
He displayed injustice,
or even cruelty.

472
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,420
Maybe those who crucified
Him loved Him...

473
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,300
because they helped in
this divine plan.

474
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:14,369
Do you understand what you
are saying?

475
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:20,130
They'll exile you to the
north, man, to renovate the icons.

476
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,139
Am l not right? You too always
say what you think.

477
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:31,269
But l'm not a monk; l'm free.

478
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:52,170
THE HOLIDAY
spring 1408

479
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,480
Sergei, over here!

480
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:16,369
Foma, let's get some logs.

481
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:26,250
Piotr as probably never seen either
Assumption Cathedral so...

482
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,500
Saint Dimitry Cathedral.

483
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,260
Never mind, he will begin working,
and understand things.

484
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:35,510
Foma Where are you?

485
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:38,510
We don't be on time.

486
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:40,510
lt's okay, we'll be there tomorrow.

487
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:43,389
No. We'll never finish the Cathedral
of the Assumption by winter.

488
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,400
lt's almost June, Andrei.

489
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,460
What is it?

490
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,340
Quiet! Do you hear it?

491
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:04,469
Nightingales?

492
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:06,469
Nothing else?

493
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,599
Come on.

494
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,480
-What is it?
-Come on.

495
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,480
They're practicing witchcraft.

496
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,380
Where are you going?

497
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:45,510
Come to me.

498
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,500
Hold on.

499
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,619
Come to me.

500
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:49,510
Darling.

501
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:53,510
Take your hand away.

502
00:59:54,809 --> 00:59:56,510
There is an anthill.

503
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,519
Anthill?

504
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:11,530
Anthill.

505
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:13,530
Who is this?

506
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:14,650
l don't know.

507
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:16,530
Let's go.

508
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,139
lt seemed to me as if a black
snake was hiding himself.

509
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:02,510
What are you doing?

510
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:07,510
Let me go!

511
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,510
We'll let you go.

512
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:14,150
At dawn, we'll hang a stone around
your neck, to help you swim.

513
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,159
Heaven's fire will consume you!
The Last Judgment awaits!

514
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:29,050
Now we'll tie you to this cross
like Jesus Christ.

515
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,659
No!

516
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,300
What are you doing, men?
You can't to this to me.

517
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,300
This is a sin. At least hang
me upside-down.

518
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:43,550
Men, brothers!

519
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:52,070
Leave him here for the night,
unless he ascends again.

520
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:56,380
He's not going anywhere.

521
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:13,510
And who is this?

522
01:03:13,809 --> 01:03:14,630
Marfa.

523
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:23,159
Why did you want to be head down?
It would have been worse.

524
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,280
Why did you threaten us with
fire from heaven?

525
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:33,289
lt is a sin to go naked and
do what you do.

526
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:41,920
What sin? Tonight is for
Iovemaking; is love a sin?

527
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,420
ls it to tie a man up like this?

528
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,420
You might call the monks...

529
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:51,429
who would force us to
accept your faith.

530
01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:55,369
Do you think it's easy
to live in fear?

531
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:58,369
You live in fear because
you know no...

532
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:00,489
love but bestial love.

533
01:04:00,789 --> 01:04:04,250
Carnality without soul; but love
should be brotherly.

534
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,260
lsn't all love the same?
It's just love.

535
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,380
What are you doing?

536
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,519
Untie me.

537
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:42,510
Why are you looking at me?

538
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,510
Where were you?

539
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,519
Thank God.

540
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,460
Are these the people?

541
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,340
No, these are strangers.
Don't you see it?

542
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:13,349
,
There is some onion
if you want it.

543
01:08:21,789 --> 01:08:23,489
Where were you?

544
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:32,130
These forests are impenetrable;
l'm all scratched.

545
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,380
The local people like it. They are
accustomed to it.

546
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,380
For people, everything is a
matter of custom.

547
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,380
Old people don't need to think...

548
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:47,270
for their days pass according
to custom.

549
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:52,270
But perhaps they consciously
enjoy...

550
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:55,340
the way the days drag on.

551
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:17,350
Couldn't you get here before?

552
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,479
No. l couldn't.

553
01:09:19,779 --> 01:09:23,239
That is your sin, your conscience,
your prayers.

554
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,489
Get him, and her!

555
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,390
Why are they doing that?

556
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:57,149
Because the accursed pagans don't
believe in one God.

557
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:03,279
Don't look, Sergei. There is
nothing to look at.

558
01:10:03,819 --> 01:10:05,520
Let me go!

559
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:08,520
Let me go!

560
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,529
You can't see that!

561
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,420
Kich so he shuts up!

562
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,550
Go, go! Don't dawdle!

563
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,430
Help, Fyodor! Help!

564
01:10:40,859 --> 01:10:42,560
Fyodor!

565
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:47,560
Can't you deal with a woman?

566
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,449
Stop!

567
01:10:52,869 --> 01:10:53,689
Hold her!

568
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,510
Marfa, run!

569
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,510
Catch her!

570
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:11,279
-Where are you going?
-She will drown herself!

571
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:13,520
Marfa! Run, Marfa!

572
01:11:19,829 --> 01:11:21,529
Swim, Marfa!

573
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:20,039
THE LAST JUDGMENT
Summer 1408

574
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:22,520
Come here!

575
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:28,409
He's just wasting materials.

576
01:12:28,829 --> 01:12:30,529
Who needs it?

577
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,659
Foma!

578
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,539
What do you want?

579
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,539
Can l go for a swim?

580
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,539
No, you can't.

581
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,539
lt's hot!

582
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:45,550
Don't be lying. It's not.

583
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:48,430
Maybe he's really hot.
l'm hot too.

584
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,550
N course, you are working
and he is sitting.

585
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:51,670
Let him go swim.

586
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:51,670
Don't spoil him.

587
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:55,489
Let him be sitting with everyone.

588
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:57,489
You shut up!

589
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,380
You sleep all day long like a log...

590
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,260
and you come down only to eat
and go to the bathroom.

591
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,500
And have you found a job for me?

592
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,500
-You have found what you wanted.
-So what?

593
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:13,149
Since everyone is sitting here, let
Serezhka be sitting with us to.

594
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:16,390
lf you had let him go, he would
have been back already.

595
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,510
Give him freedom...

596
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:20,520
and he will in the water until
he turns blue.

597
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:23,399
He only thinks that it's hot...

598
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:25,520
-and that's why he is whining.
-He's not whining,...

599
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:26,640
you are.

600
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,640
lt was me.

601
01:13:27,829 --> 01:13:30,409
l was the first to say it's hot,
and not Sergei.

602
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:32,529
Why are you picking on Sergei?

603
01:13:33,829 --> 01:13:34,649
That's it!

604
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:36,529
You want to go swimming, go!

605
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,529
Go! Why are you sitting?

606
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,539
Go, go!

607
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,539
Here! You see?

608
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,420
Wait! Wait!

609
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,550
Where's Andrei?

610
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:51,670
Not here?

611
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:55,250
Not here? This is a fine
state of affairs.

612
01:14:00,789 --> 01:14:03,369
l was our bishop's house
just now.

613
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:06,369
Such a fuss. Yelling!

614
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,140
He was purple with rage. ''l've
Iost patience!'' He cried.

615
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,380
He meant you. All of you.

616
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,270
,
''For two whole months,'' he said
everything has been ready.

617
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,510
But they haven't started yet.

618
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:26,270
Nothing is ready; they asked for
so much money, but do nothing.

619
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:29,399
None of them is working and
nothing is ready.''

620
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:32,399
Did you ask for a lot of money?

621
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:34,520
How do l know?

622
01:14:34,829 --> 01:14:40,050
He said, ''l don't care. Danil
Chorny or Andrei Rublev...

623
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:43,409
it's all the same to me.''

624
01:14:43,829 --> 01:14:45,529
''lt's all the same.''

625
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,300
And he pulled a face like this.

626
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,420
''What do l care about
Andrei Rublev?

627
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:57,479
By autumn,'' he says...

628
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:01,239
''l want the cathedral painted,
and that's that!''

629
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:05,250
He's sent a courier with a complaint
to the Grand Prince.

630
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:08,369
He's sent a courier to the
Grand Prince.

631
01:15:09,789 --> 01:15:12,369
lt's a complaint about you,
you know.

632
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,500
You haven't started yet.

633
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,140
You'd better hurry up.
Where's Andrei?

634
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:26,510
He's gone somewhere again.

635
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:29,390
Can't you start without him?

636
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:31,510
Go on, start without him.

637
01:15:34,819 --> 01:15:37,399
Why are you smirking? There
are so many of you.

638
01:15:37,819 --> 01:15:40,399
lf he can't make his mind up,
can't one of you?

639
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:42,520
Two heads are better than one.

640
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:45,529
Where is Andrei?

641
01:15:48,829 --> 01:15:51,409
l can't go on like that.

642
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,359
Answer me: yes or no?

643
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:57,350
Yes or no? Wasn't everything
decided in Moscow?

644
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:02,989
To the smallest detail; the Prince
said everything was in order.

645
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:11,000
What is not clear? What have we
been discussing for two months?

646
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:16,250
Explain it to me. l may be old,
l may have lost my wits.

647
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:21,130
The Last Judgment; either you
accept the task and paint it...

648
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,380
or you refuse the commission.

649
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,260
And if we really refused? If we
went back, Danil?

650
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,270
How shall l face people?
l should die of shame.

651
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:39,149
We're wasting such good time.
This heat, no rain.

652
01:16:39,819 --> 01:16:42,399
We could have finished the cupola
and the columns.

653
01:16:42,819 --> 01:16:45,399
How wonderfully they could
have been done...

654
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:49,279
how brightly, and beautifully.
On the right sinners...

655
01:16:49,829 --> 01:16:54,989
boiling in pitch, painted to make
your flesh crawl.

656
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:01,229
l have thought of a great devil, with
smoke from his nose and eyes.

657
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:05,229
-lt's not the smoke that matters.
-Then what matters?

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:06,600
l don't know.

659
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:09,359
-Why aren't you looking at me?
-Because l can't.

660
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,140
l can't paint all that;
it disgusts me.

661
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,500
l don't want to terrify people.
Understand me, Danil.

662
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:36,510
Collect yourself! Listen!

663
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:40,390
lt's the Last judgment!

664
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,510
l didn't invent it.

665
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:45,390
l can't do it. Do as you will,
but l can't.

666
01:17:45,819 --> 01:17:47,520
Why didn't you speak earlier,
in Moscow?

667
01:17:47,819 --> 01:17:50,399
You shouldn't have agreed.

668
01:17:51,819 --> 01:17:50,399
This is dishonest.

669
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:58,100
l am what l am. You couldn't
teach me integrity.

670
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:16,479
l don't know what to paint.

671
01:18:17,779 --> 01:18:19,479
What do you mean,
you don't know?

672
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:22,359
We were ordered to paint the
Last Judgment.

673
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:28,489
You see...

674
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:30,489
l think it will be better...

675
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,369
if we don't paint the Last
Judgment at all.

676
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,500
What do you mean?

677
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,500
You know.

678
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,500
l want...

679
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:42,500
l don't want anything.

680
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:55,449
-Nothing.
-That's it.

681
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,340
Well, l leaving.

682
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,460
This is no work for me.

683
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:14,989
Thanks for you kindness and your
slaps; l learned something.

684
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:18,350
But now l'm going to work
for myself.

685
01:19:21,779 --> 01:19:25,239
They've asked me to paint a
church at Pafnutievo.

686
01:19:25,779 --> 01:19:27,479
Not a great honor, but it's
still an honor.

687
01:19:28,789 --> 01:19:31,369
l'm going to paint the
Last Judgment.

688
01:19:33,789 --> 01:19:35,489
Who will come with me?

689
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,500
Well, then, stay...

690
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,380
But don't complain later.

691
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:02,399
When l was a child...

692
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:06,279
l speak as a child, l understood as
a child, l thought as a child...

693
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:09,399
but when l became a man,...

694
01:20:09,829 --> 01:20:12,409
l put away childish things.

695
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:15,409
For now we see through
a glass, darkly...

696
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:20,170
but then face to face
now l know in part...

697
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,539
but then shall l know...

698
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,539
even as also l am know.

699
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,539
And now abideth...

700
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,420
faith, hope, and charity...

701
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:33,310
but the greatest of these
is charity.

702
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:37,310
Though l speak with the tongues
of men and of angels...

703
01:20:38,859 --> 01:20:40,560
and have not charity...

704
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:43,439
l am become as sounding brass,
or a tinkling cymbal.

705
01:20:43,859 --> 01:20:46,439
And though l have the
gift of prophecy...

706
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:49,439
and understand all mysteries,
and all knowledge...

707
01:20:49,869 --> 01:20:52,449
and though l have all faith, so that
l could remove mountains...

708
01:20:52,869 --> 01:20:55,390
and have not charity,
l am nothing.

709
01:20:55,810 --> 01:21:00,149
And though l bestow all my
goods to feed the poor...

710
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:03,390
and thought l give my body to be
burned, and have not charity...

711
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:07,390
it profiteth me nothing.

712
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:12,159
Charity suffereth long, and is kind;
charity envieth not...

713
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:14,520
charity vaunteth not itself, is
not puffed up...

714
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,529
doth not behave itself unseemly...

715
01:21:17,829 --> 01:21:19,529
seeketh not her own, is not
easily provoked,...

716
01:21:19,829 --> 01:21:21,529
thinketh no evil.

717
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:25,289
rejoiceth not in iniquity, but
rejoiceth in the truth...

718
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,420
beareth all things...

719
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,420
believeth all things, hopeth
all things,...

720
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,539
endureth all things.

721
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,550
Charity never faileth...

722
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:43,430
but whether there be prophecies,
they shall fail...

723
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,550
whether there be tongues,
they shall cease...

724
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,439
whether there be knowledge,
it shall vanish away.

725
01:21:48,859 --> 01:21:51,439
For we know in part...

726
01:21:53,829 --> 01:21:56,380
Princess, is that nice?

727
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,500
lt's sinful to splash milk.

728
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,500
Such a naughtiness.

729
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:07,510
Why is it sinful?

730
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:10,390
Because...wipe it off.

731
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:13,390
But it will dry by itself
in a minute.

732
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:16,399
Let's walk by the stream.

733
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:24,279
Let me go, Stepan, or l'll send
you to the stables.

734
01:22:27,829 --> 01:22:31,289
How do you like it? l couldn't imagine
it better. It's light, beautiful.

735
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,300
lt's light.

736
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:48,550
lt's light.

737
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,250
Take her out. Her nurses
have spoiled her.

738
01:22:54,789 --> 01:22:56,489
l say!

739
01:22:56,789 --> 01:22:59,369
No one can build a mansion
better than us.

740
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,380
Who could paint like that?

741
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,260
Only Mitiai can do this directly,
without tracing.

742
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,500
lt's like a bird singind.

743
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:13,270
Look. Maybe it is like a
bird singind.

744
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:18,149
l don't care. l can sleep on the hay.
You are the Grand Prince.

745
01:23:19,819 --> 01:23:21,520
Don't you like it?

746
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:23,520
l'll tell you this. It should
be repainted.

747
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:27,279
Walls, ceiling, everything:
brighter, stronger colors.

748
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:31,409
l've been in this trade for
forty years.

749
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:32,649
lt's not the years that matter...

750
01:23:32,829 --> 01:23:34,529
but your ability to glorify the
Grand Prince with your work.

751
01:23:35,829 --> 01:23:37,529
That's enough. Go.

752
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,539
We won't redo anything.

753
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,420
lt's time to go. We
have another job.

754
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,539
They are waiting for us
in Zvenigorod.

755
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:49,670
Where?

756
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:52,430
At your brother's. They have
the stone already.

757
01:23:53,819 --> 01:23:57,250
A beautiful stone. Whiter
than this.

758
01:23:57,789 --> 01:24:00,369
When your brother came
at Easter...

759
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:05,130
we made a deal and he said: ''Do what
you like, whatever the cost.

760
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:09,260
l'll tax the peasants more,
just build me the...''

761
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,500
best mansion possible.

762
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,500
Then go to Zvenigorod.

763
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,500
Stepan!

764
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:20,510
Here, l have brought it.

765
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:27,270
,
When l looked at the Prince
be become numb.

766
01:24:27,819 --> 01:24:32,159
-When l mentioned Zvenigorod?
-Yes, he became paralyzed.

767
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:36,279
He fears his brother will
outshine him.

768
01:24:37,829 --> 01:24:39,529
Who carved that?

769
01:24:39,829 --> 01:24:41,529
l did.

770
01:24:41,829 --> 01:24:44,409
Why didn't you set in the wall?

771
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,539
lt didn't come out right.

772
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,539
Pity; It's rather good.

773
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:56,000
Everything crumbles: l told the Prince
to spare no expense on the stone.

774
01:24:56,779 --> 01:25:00,239
Maybe now he's sorry when he
heard about Zvenigorod.

775
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:03,359
l could have carved beautiful
things for him.

776
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:09,489
Come on, you ass!

777
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:26,390
Where's Stepan?

778
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:32,390
Where did Stepan gallop to?

779
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:35,399
He went Zvenigorod
with others.

780
01:25:42,829 --> 01:25:44,529
l've dirtied my hands.

781
01:26:02,779 --> 01:26:05,359
We'll build another mansion
just as good for the...

782
01:26:05,779 --> 01:26:07,479
Prince's brother.

783
01:26:07,779 --> 01:26:09,479
Will the stone be better there?

784
01:26:11,789 --> 01:26:12,609
Yes, it will.

785
01:26:12,789 --> 01:26:15,369
Look, the Captain of the Guard.

786
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,380
Hold on, old man.

787
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:14,239
You, ass! Help him! In the bushes!

788
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:26,489
Where's my whip?

789
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:50,399
Has anyone seen my whip?

790
01:27:51,819 --> 01:27:56,979
Damn. l've lost it. Have you
seen my whip, ass?

791
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:24,670
Seryoga.

792
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:26,670
What?

793
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:28,680
Read the Scriptures.

794
01:30:28,979 --> 01:30:29,800
From where?

795
01:30:29,979 --> 01:30:31,680
From wherever you like.

796
01:30:42,989 --> 01:30:46,449
''lmitate me, just as l also
imitate Christ.

797
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,579
Now l praise you, brethren, that ye
remember me in all things...

798
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,579
and keep the ordinances as
l delivered them to you.

799
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,520
But l would have you know, that the
head of every man is Christ...

800
01:30:56,939 --> 01:30:58,640
and the head of the woman
is the man...

801
01:30:58,939 --> 01:31:00,640
and the head of Christ is God.

802
01:31:00,939 --> 01:31:02,640
Every man praying or prophesying,
having his head covered...

803
01:31:03,949 --> 01:31:08,289
dishonoreth his head. But every
woman that prayeth...

804
01:31:08,949 --> 01:31:13,289
or prophesieth...

805
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,420
,
with her head uncovered
dishonoreth her head...

806
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,539
for that is even all one as if
she were shaven.

807
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,420
,
For if the woman be not covered
Iet her also be shorn...

808
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:27,550
but if it be shame for a woman
to be shorn or shaven...

809
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:30,550
let her be covered.

810
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:34,550
For a man ought not to cover
his head...

811
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:37,560
forasmuch as he is the image
and glory of God...

812
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:40,560
but the woman is the glory
of the man.

813
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:43,560
For the man is not of the woman;
but the woman of the man.

814
01:31:43,989 --> 01:31:45,689
Neither was the man created for
the woman; but the...

815
01:31:45,989 --> 01:31:47,689
woman for the man.

816
01:31:47,989 --> 01:31:51,449
For this cause ought the woman to
have power on her head...

817
01:31:51,989 --> 01:31:54,569
because of the angels.

818
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,520
Nevertheless neither is the man
without the woman...

819
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,630
neither the woman without the
man, in the Lord.''

820
01:32:03,939 --> 01:32:05,640
Go on reading.

821
01:32:13,949 --> 01:32:16,529
,
''For as the woman is of the man
even so is, even so is the man...

822
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:24,039
also by the woman; but all
things of God.

823
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,420
Judge in yourselves: is it comely...

824
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:31,670
that a woman pray unto
God uncovered?

825
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:35,550
Doth not even nature itself teach
you that, if a man have...

826
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,670
long hair it is a shame unto him?
But if a woman have long hair,...

827
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,670
it is a glory to her for her
hair is given her for...

828
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,539
Why have you stopped? Read.

829
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,420
But if a woman have long hair,
it is a glory for her...

830
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,539
But if any man seen to
be contentious...

831
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:43,189
we have no such custom
neither the Churches of God.

832
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:47,430
Now in this that l declare unto you
l praise you not...

833
01:33:49,979 --> 01:33:54,319
that ye come together not for the
better but for the worse.

834
01:34:31,949 --> 01:34:33,649
Danil ,listen.

835
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,659
lt's a feast.

836
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,539
lt's a feast, Danil, and
you are saying...

837
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,659
They are not sinners...

838
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:46,300
She is not a sinner, even if she
dose not a wear a scarf.

839
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,380
She is not a sinner.

840
01:35:28,939 --> 01:35:33,279
Leave him alone. Let God's
servant repent.

841
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,090
THE PASSlON
According to Andrei Part Two.

842
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:41,470
THE RAID
Autumn of 1408

843
01:37:01,970 --> 01:37:06,310
They are coming! The Tatars
are coming, Prince!

844
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,539
Hey, Prince! Is this your ford?

845
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,420
lt has been raining, and everything
is flooded. Follow us.

846
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:34,449
We were just going to leave. We
expected you yesterday.

847
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,460
l couldn't resist attacking a small
town on my way.

848
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,699
l am sorry l am late.

849
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,340
Never mind. Let's go. It will be
shallow to the left.

850
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:49,710
Keep to the left.
This isn't a trap?

851
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:52,590
Believe me, Vladimir is deserted.

852
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:52,590
My brother, the Grand Prince,
is in Lithuania.

853
01:38:55,989 --> 01:38:59,420
Here is the town, behind
that forest.

854
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:03,420
They say the Prince has a son,
but you want the throne.

855
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,659
We'll see.

856
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:11,300
l see you want the throne.
l understand.

857
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:19,550
You were told to keep left.

858
01:39:22,979 --> 01:39:24,680
Grab this!

859
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:02,520
Come on, Prince! Don't lag behind!

860
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:15,659
Strong is your love for your brother.

861
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,659
This is our destiny.

862
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,539
When were you last reconciled
with him?

863
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:25,550
l never was. The Metropolitan
summoned us...

864
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:28,550
and made us kiss the cross and
swear to live in harmony.

865
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:29,789
What are you saying?

866
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:32,550
The Metropolitan summoned us to
kiss the cross.

867
01:41:32,979 --> 01:41:34,680
-When?
-Last winter.

868
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,659
Vladimir is a beautiful town.

869
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:32,670
Do you like it?

870
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:35,789
Yes.

871
01:42:41,979 --> 01:42:43,680
Let's go.

872
01:43:28,579 --> 01:43:32,039
Forward! You dog, stay close,
or l'll kill you!

873
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:36,170
Keep close to the Prince!
To the gates!

874
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:38,409
Let's go.

875
01:44:30,579 --> 01:44:32,279
Tatars!

876
01:44:33,579 --> 01:44:35,279
Run away!

877
01:45:41,579 --> 01:45:43,279
What is going on?

878
01:47:13,979 --> 01:47:15,680
The Grand Prince is coming.

879
01:47:26,989 --> 01:47:29,569
The brother has arrived.

880
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:40,329
Hold him, hold him!

881
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:55,100
Brothers, what are you doing?
We Are all fellow Russians.

882
01:48:56,579 --> 01:49:00,039
l'll show you if we are fellow
Russians, you Vladimir swine

883
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:07,170
Catch him! Catch him!

884
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:14,289
Run around! Don't you hear me?

885
01:49:34,619 --> 01:49:37,199
Where the devil are we?
There's no one here.

886
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:39,319
They've all fled.

887
01:49:46,630 --> 01:49:49,210
How your bitch has grown; doesn't
remember me, eh?

888
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:53,329
Vaska, take the dog.

889
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:15,289
Oh please, let me go!

890
01:50:34,609 --> 01:50:37,189
Don't be afraid, beautiful.

891
01:50:37,609 --> 01:50:40,189
l'll show you how Tatars can love.

892
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:27,289
Well, Prince!

893
01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:32,050
Aren't you sorry about
the cathedral?

894
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:13,010
Tell me Prince, who is that woman?

895
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,899
lt's no woman, the Virgin Mary:
the Nativity.

896
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,260
Who is in the box?

897
01:55:26,569 --> 01:55:28,270
Christ, her son.

898
01:55:29,569 --> 01:55:32,149
How can she be a virgin if
she has a son?

899
01:55:38,579 --> 01:55:41,159
Strange things happen in Russia!

900
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:47,289
Very interesting.

901
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:52,170
Tie his legs tighter!

902
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,300
Tell the truth, you dog!

903
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:01,060
Hold on, hold on! l haven't
seen your gold.

904
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:05,430
By God, by God, l haven't seen it!

905
01:56:07,609 --> 01:56:09,310
lt hurts!

906
01:56:16,619 --> 01:56:20,079
l don't know where the gold is;
it probably was stolen.

907
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:27,970
Your Tatars must have taken it.
You're all thieves.

908
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:32,329
Ask around your own men.

909
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:42,340
He hasn't told the truth.

910
01:56:43,649 --> 01:56:46,229
Come here, l'll tell you
something.

911
01:56:49,649 --> 01:56:53,109
See how the devils torture an
innocent Russian believer.

912
01:56:54,659 --> 01:56:57,180
Look you Judas,
you dirty Tatar!

913
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,300
You lie, l'm Russian.

914
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:06,060
l recognize you. You resemble
your brother.

915
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:11,060
You've sold Russia!
l recognized you!

916
01:58:58,579 --> 01:59:00,279
Mark may words!

917
01:59:01,579 --> 01:59:05,039
''No Tatar shall ever set foot
on Russian soil.''

918
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:08,170
This is my vow to the Lord.

919
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:15,050
Give me a cross. Let a believer
kiss the cross.

920
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:17,300
You'll get your cross.

921
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:23,060
lf l have sinned, may God forgive.
God is merciful.

922
01:59:25,609 --> 01:59:27,310
Lord, will you pardon me?

923
01:59:29,609 --> 01:59:32,189
But all you will boil in pitch.

924
01:59:36,619 --> 01:59:40,079
You will leave and we will
rebuild again...

925
01:59:41,619 --> 01:59:45,960
but your guts will go to
the fires of hell.

926
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:17,170
What are you doing this for?

927
02:05:25,569 --> 02:05:29,029
Theophanes? Bur you are dead.

928
02:05:36,579 --> 02:05:39,159
l want to see you so much.

929
02:05:39,579 --> 02:05:43,039
Even if you had not wanted, l would
have come anyway.

930
02:05:44,590 --> 02:05:49,810
l dreamed you were suspended in a
window with your head down.

931
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:53,170
You look in, and wag your
finger at me...

932
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:57,180
and l'm lying across a saddle...

933
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:01,180
and two Tatars twist my head.

934
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:05,180
And you look at me, and tap
on the window.

935
02:06:05,609 --> 02:06:07,310
Toc... toc...

936
02:06:08,609 --> 02:06:10,310
And l cry out to you.

937
02:06:10,609 --> 02:06:12,310
What do you cry?

938
02:06:13,609 --> 02:06:16,189
What's happening to us?

939
02:06:16,619 --> 02:06:20,079
We are being murdered and raped.

940
02:06:21,619 --> 02:06:24,199
Together with Tatars, they are
pillaging churches.

941
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:28,329
And you said to me...

942
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:37,090
Only now l'm worse off than you.

943
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:41,220
You're dead, but l...

944
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:46,220
Dead? What of it?

945
02:06:46,649 --> 02:06:48,350
l didn't mean that.

946
02:06:50,649 --> 02:06:54,109
l've spent half my life
in blindness.

947
02:06:57,590 --> 02:07:01,050
l worked for people day
and night.

948
02:07:17,609 --> 02:07:20,189
But they aren't people,
are they?

949
02:07:24,619 --> 02:07:27,199
What you said was true.

950
02:07:30,619 --> 02:07:34,079
So what if l said it then?

951
02:07:35,630 --> 02:07:39,090
You are wrong now, l was
wrong then.

952
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:43,340
But haven't we the same faith...

953
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:45,340
the same land...

954
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:47,340
the same blood?

955
02:07:51,649 --> 02:07:53,350
One Tatar even smiled.

956
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:01,409
Like this!

957
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:07,289
And shouted:

958
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:12,060
''Even without us you'll cut each
other's throats!''

959
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:16,300
What a disgrace.

960
02:08:18,609 --> 02:08:20,310
They killed everyone.

961
02:08:23,609 --> 02:08:25,310
Even my Seryoga.

962
02:08:27,619 --> 02:08:30,199
l found him on such a special day.

963
02:08:35,619 --> 02:08:38,199
She is the only one that survived.

964
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:55,220
lt's time for me to go.

965
02:08:58,579 --> 02:09:00,279
Wait.

966
02:09:02,579 --> 02:09:06,920
Don't go. Don't you like being
with me; are you bored?

967
02:09:08,590 --> 02:09:10,289
All right, l won't...

968
02:09:10,590 --> 02:09:12,289
Let's sit and talk. l'll tell you...

969
02:09:12,590 --> 02:09:14,289
But l already know everything.

970
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:18,939
Then you know l'll never paint again.

971
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:24,300
Why so?

972
02:09:24,609 --> 02:09:28,069
Because it's of no use to anyone.
That's all.

973
02:09:28,609 --> 02:09:31,189
So what? Your iconostasis
was burned.

974
02:09:31,609 --> 02:09:34,189
Do you know how many of mine they
burned? In Pskov, Novgorod...

975
02:09:35,619 --> 02:09:37,319
You are committing a grave sin.

976
02:09:39,619 --> 02:09:42,199
l haven't told you the worst.

977
02:09:43,619 --> 02:09:46,199
l killed a man.

978
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:51,329
A fellow Russian.

979
02:09:58,569 --> 02:10:00,270
When l saw him carrying her off.

980
02:10:06,579 --> 02:10:08,279
Look at her.

981
02:10:10,579 --> 02:10:12,279
Just look at her!

982
02:10:12,590 --> 02:10:14,289
l don't remember how it happened.

983
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:19,289
l caught up with him...

984
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:24,050
and l couldn't help it.

985
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:28,939
Through our sins, evil has
assumed human form.

986
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:33,939
Encroaching evil means
encroaching humanity.

987
02:10:35,609 --> 02:10:39,949
God will forgive you; don't
forgive yourself.

988
02:10:40,609 --> 02:10:44,069
Live, between divine forgiveness
and your own torment.

989
02:10:45,619 --> 02:10:50,840
As for your sins, what do your
scriptures say?

990
02:10:52,630 --> 02:10:56,909
''Learn to do good: seek justice...

991
02:10:58,569 --> 02:11:02,909
rebuke the oppressor, defend the
fatherless, plead for the widow.

992
02:11:03,569 --> 02:11:07,029
Come now, and let us reason
together, saith the Lord...

993
02:11:07,569 --> 02:11:10,149
thought your sins be as scarlet...

994
02:11:11,579 --> 02:11:14,159
they shall be as white as snow.''

995
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:22,050
See, l haven't forgotten; that
may comfort you.

996
02:11:23,590 --> 02:11:27,050
l know, God is merciful and
will pardon me.

997
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:33,060
l shall offer the Lord
vow of silence.

998
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:40,060
l have nothing more to
say to people.

999
02:11:42,609 --> 02:11:44,310
ls this a good idea?

1000
02:11:44,609 --> 02:11:48,069
l have no right to advise you.

1001
02:11:49,619 --> 02:11:52,199
Didn't you go to heaven?

1002
02:11:52,619 --> 02:11:54,319
Lord!

1003
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:59,899
l can only say it is not as you
imagine it on earth.

1004
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:03,260
Russia, Russia

1005
02:12:06,569 --> 02:12:10,909
Our mother country suffers all;
she will endure all.

1006
02:12:13,569 --> 02:12:16,149
But how long will this go on?

1007
02:12:21,579 --> 02:12:25,039
,
l don't know. Forever
most likely.

1008
02:12:28,590 --> 02:12:31,170
Yet how beautiful all this is.

1009
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:42,300
lt's snowing.

1010
02:12:47,609 --> 02:12:52,829
Nothing is more terrible than snow
falling in a temple.

1011
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:53,819
THE CHARITY
Winter 1412

1012
02:16:38,639 --> 02:16:41,219
The apples are all rotten.

1013
02:16:45,649 --> 02:16:49,110
ln all my years, l've never seen
such a famine.

1014
02:16:49,649 --> 02:16:52,229
We are slowly dying out.
Lord have pity on us.

1015
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:58,170
Mefody is bringing someone again.

1016
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:10,180
Mefody, you should not be
the gate-keeper...

1017
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:13,180
because you will let the people the
whole neighborhood in here to eat.

1018
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:17,190
-Sit down, man of God.
-Thank you.

1019
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:20,309
To eat!

1020
02:17:20,610 --> 02:17:24,069
You can't feed all the
hungry people.

1021
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:29,200
There is no one in the
neighborhood.

1022
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:32,200
The villages are deserted.

1023
02:17:36,629 --> 02:17:39,209
Everyone has left Khotkovo.

1024
02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:44,340
The people of Semyonovka
have fled.

1025
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:46,340
They've fled, they've fled!

1026
02:17:46,639 --> 02:17:49,219
lt's true. l passed Semyonovka
this morning.

1027
02:17:49,639 --> 02:17:51,340
ln Vladimir it is even worse.

1028
02:17:51,649 --> 02:17:54,229
No harvest for three years;
everyone has fled.

1029
02:17:54,649 --> 02:17:56,290
Those who stayed are eating mice.

1030
02:17:56,579 --> 02:17:58,280
Why are you whispering?

1031
02:17:58,590 --> 02:18:01,170
l'm not whispering. l have a cold.
l spent a night in a lake.

1032
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:03,290
Why was that?

1033
02:18:03,590 --> 02:18:08,809
,
Wolves chased me; l fled to the lake
praying they wouldn't follow.

1034
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:11,299
l was starting like that till dawn.

1035
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:14,180
When l got out, l was
completely numb.

1036
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:18,940
l've been sick for two weeks and
l'm shivering all over.

1037
02:18:19,610 --> 02:18:22,190
-So you're from Vladimir.
-So used to live there.

1038
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:25,190
Someone else from
Vladimir is here.

1039
02:18:25,610 --> 02:18:29,069
Andrei Rublev. Here you
heard of him?

1040
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:34,079
He has sinned, and now
he is atoning.

1041
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:36,319
He has brought a holy fool with
him from Vladimir.

1042
02:18:36,620 --> 02:18:38,319
A mute girl.

1043
02:18:38,629 --> 02:18:41,209
Now they are silent together.

1044
02:18:50,639 --> 02:18:53,219
Though she is a holy fool, she
knows where to...

1045
02:18:53,639 --> 02:18:53,219
get better food.

1046
02:18:55,610 --> 02:18:57,280
He has brought her...

1047
02:18:57,579 --> 02:19:01,040
so that he may always
remember his sin.

1048
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:08,170
Can you call it holiness?

1049
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:12,290
And Rublev's guild?

1050
02:19:12,590 --> 02:19:14,290
lt fell apart.

1051
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:19,059
Some were killed by Tatars...

1052
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:22,180
others were driven away.

1053
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:24,299
ls Danil alive?

1054
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:28,940
Some say he went north,
others say he died.

1055
02:19:30,610 --> 02:19:33,190
So he's given up his craft?

1056
02:19:33,610 --> 02:19:35,309
Aren't you Kirill?

1057
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:43,200
Kirill, is it you?

1058
02:20:00,569 --> 02:20:03,149
Father! Master! Kirill has
come back!

1059
02:20:09,579 --> 02:20:13,920
Father! Let your prodigal son
Kirill back in!

1060
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:20,170
You didn't ask me if you
could leave...

1061
02:20:20,590 --> 02:20:22,290
and now you want to come back?

1062
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:24,299
You didn't like it in the
secular world?

1063
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:26,299
No, l won't take you in.

1064
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:29,180
My God, why hast thou
forsaken me?

1065
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:32,180
Now you want back into the
den of thieves...

1066
02:20:32,610 --> 02:20:34,309
to the money-changers
and dove-sellers.

1067
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:38,069
You think because l am old, l have
forgotten about it.

1068
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:41,190
Begone! Go back to where
you came from!

1069
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:44,200
There is no truth in the world.
The devil tempted me.

1070
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:47,200
l can't continue sinning...

1071
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:50,200
and without sin you cannot live
in the secular world.

1072
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:54,079
There is sin and dirt all around.

1073
02:20:54,629 --> 02:20:57,149
Accept my penitence and l will
kiss your feet.

1074
02:20:57,559 --> 02:21:01,020
You were always eloquent, but
you won't move me, Kirill.

1075
02:21:02,569 --> 02:21:06,030
lf you knew how l've suffered,
what l've endured...

1076
02:21:06,569 --> 02:21:10,030
if you knew what evil l've seen,
you would forgive me...

1077
02:21:10,579 --> 02:21:12,280
but l will never forgive myself.

1078
02:21:12,579 --> 02:21:16,040
You're not guilty before me,
but before God.

1079
02:21:18,590 --> 02:21:22,049
Remain here; but to
eKpiate your sin...

1080
02:21:22,590 --> 02:21:26,049
you must copy out the Scriptures
fifteen times.

1081
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:29,170
Take the late Nikodim's cell.

1082
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,180
Thank you! Thank you, God!

1083
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:39,059
How wonderful! Thank you,
father, thank you!

1084
02:25:08,549 --> 02:25:12,010
Hey, it's bad to eat dirty meat.

1085
02:25:34,569 --> 02:25:37,149
Brothers, what's going on?

1086
02:25:37,579 --> 02:25:40,159
l'll go to tell Father Nikodim.

1087
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:44,219
A good Russian. She eats
horsemeat.

1088
02:26:45,649 --> 02:26:48,229
Do you want to come with me?
You'll be my wife.

1089
02:26:52,649 --> 02:26:48,229
l have seven wives, but no
Russian wife.

1090
02:26:55,620 --> 02:26:59,049
You will eat horsemeat every
day, drink horse milk,...

1091
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:01,290
wear coins in hair.

1092
02:28:00,590 --> 02:28:04,049
Russian wife for Tatar
husband is never dirty.

1093
02:29:10,590 --> 02:29:12,290
Girl! Come with us!

1094
02:29:28,610 --> 02:29:31,190
Come! Give me your hand!

1095
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:28,299
Do you hear me, Andrei?

1096
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:44,319
Don't you recognize me?

1097
02:31:10,579 --> 02:31:14,040
Don't grieve, they'll her go.

1098
02:31:16,579 --> 02:31:20,040
They won't dare harm a holy
fool. It's a sin.

1099
02:31:55,590 --> 02:32:01,659
THE BELL Spring-Summer-Autumn
Winter-Spring 1423-1424

1100
02:32:27,590 --> 02:32:29,290
,
Is this the home of Nikolka
the bell-maker?

1101
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:32,409
lt is.

1102
02:32:32,590 --> 02:32:34,290
ls he your father?

1103
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:36,420
Yes.

1104
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:38,299
Then call him.

1105
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:41,299
-He's not here.
-Where is he?

1106
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:44,299
He's dead.

1107
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:51,950
The plague took them all:
mother, sister, father.

1108
02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:51,950
And where does Gravrila the
bell-maker live?

1109
02:32:55,579 --> 02:32:59,010
Gravrila? He's dead, too.

1110
02:32:59,549 --> 02:33:04,770
So is Kasian, and the Tatars led
Ivashka away last year.

1111
02:33:05,559 --> 02:33:09,020
Only Fyodor is left. Go to
him; the fifth hut.

1112
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:13,139
But you should hurry; Fyodor's
in bed with the plague.

1113
02:33:13,569 --> 02:33:17,909
He can't open his eyes. He will
pass away at any moment.

1114
02:33:29,579 --> 02:33:33,920
l can't stand it any more. Where
else can we look? Let's go home.

1115
02:33:34,590 --> 02:33:37,170
Get up. You aren't going home.

1116
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:46,059
ls there no one left to
cast the bell?

1117
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:49,299
Take me with you.

1118
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:49,299
Let me cast the bell for you.

1119
02:33:55,569 --> 02:33:57,239
Are you mad, boy?

1120
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:59,239
Take to the Prince.

1121
02:33:59,549 --> 02:34:02,129
Honestly, l can make everything
very well for you.

1122
02:34:02,549 --> 02:34:07,770
You won't find anyone better
than me; they're all dead.

1123
02:34:08,549 --> 02:34:10,250
Go to hell!

1124
02:34:10,559 --> 02:34:14,899
Okay! But l know the secret of
bell-making, and l won't tell.

1125
02:34:15,559 --> 02:34:18,139
What you saying?

1126
02:34:18,559 --> 02:34:22,899
l know the secret. My father knew
the secret of bell making.

1127
02:34:23,569 --> 02:34:27,909
Before he died, he passed it to me.
No one else knows, except me.

1128
02:34:30,579 --> 02:34:34,040
My father died and passed
me the secret.

1129
02:34:35,579 --> 02:34:38,159
Shall we take him?

1130
02:34:38,579 --> 02:34:40,280
What secret?

1131
02:34:40,590 --> 02:34:43,170
Do you want the Prince
to flay us?

1132
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:45,290
He's lying about the secret.

1133
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:47,290
The worse for him!

1134
02:34:48,590 --> 02:34:51,170
-What ism your name?
-Boriska.

1135
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:53,299
Come here!

1136
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:00,360
Mount!

1137
02:35:07,549 --> 02:35:09,250
What about the hut?

1138
02:35:12,549 --> 02:35:14,250
Did you persuade him?

1139
02:35:58,600 --> 02:36:00,299
Shall we did here?

1140
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:02,299
We can it here.

1141
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:05,180
But it would be more convenient to
do it closer to the Bell-tower...

1142
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:08,180
So that we won't have to drag this
heavy thing far.

1143
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:11,190
Can't we dig here?
Let's do it here.

1144
02:36:16,620 --> 02:36:17,440
Mark it out.

1145
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:23,200
Let's dig together, shall we?

1146
02:36:26,629 --> 02:36:29,209
We're bell-casters, not diggers.

1147
02:36:29,629 --> 02:36:31,329
Why should we be digging?

1148
02:36:32,629 --> 02:36:34,329
You know what my father said...

1149
02:36:35,629 --> 02:36:38,209
before he died?

1150
02:36:39,639 --> 02:36:43,100
''Bell-casters must dig the
casting-pit.''

1151
02:36:44,639 --> 02:36:48,979
l only understood that in my old age,''
he said, and died.

1152
02:36:51,649 --> 02:36:55,110
l don't know what Nikolka said, but
l'm not going to dig.

1153
02:36:59,590 --> 02:37:02,170
Call us when you need us.

1154
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:05,299
Well?

1155
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:14,299
Did you find it?

1156
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:19,180
There is no need to look for it.
Here it is.

1157
02:38:39,629 --> 02:38:43,090
No, it's not the right clay.

1158
02:38:43,629 --> 02:38:46,209
-We always took it here.
-Then you are fools.

1159
02:38:46,629 --> 02:38:48,329
The clay is very good.

1160
02:38:48,629 --> 02:38:51,209
-Andreika, isn't the clay bad?
-Yes, it's bad.

1161
02:38:51,639 --> 02:38:53,340
You see? Come on.

1162
02:38:59,579 --> 02:39:02,159
We'll search until we
find good clay.

1163
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:13,049
Stepan, perhaps we shouldn't
have done this.

1164
02:39:14,590 --> 02:39:17,170
Come on. Look what clay we
have found.

1165
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:22,940
How hard we've worked, and now
we've found a new spot.

1166
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:25,299
lt's not the right kind.

1167
02:39:27,610 --> 02:39:31,950
lt's the end of August, and we
have not found the clay yet.

1168
02:39:32,610 --> 02:39:35,190
Think about yourself.
l'm sorry for you.

1169
02:39:35,610 --> 02:39:37,309
l've managed all these years
without your pity.

1170
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:42,200
Let's go back, Boriska.

1171
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:44,319
l can't. l know that's not
the right clay.

1172
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:46,319
Then what is right?

1173
02:39:46,629 --> 02:39:48,329
l know what is.

1174
02:39:53,629 --> 02:39:56,149
l don't need people like you.

1175
02:39:57,569 --> 02:39:59,270
l can manage without you.

1176
02:39:59,569 --> 02:40:01,270
l don't need such people!

1177
02:41:04,569 --> 02:41:06,270
Andreika!

1178
02:41:07,569 --> 02:41:09,270
Semyon!

1179
02:41:11,579 --> 02:41:13,280
l have found it!

1180
02:41:18,579 --> 02:41:21,159
Uncle Fyodor! l've found it!

1181
02:41:27,590 --> 02:41:29,290
The clay! Uncles Seymon!

1182
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:31,299
Stepan!

1183
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:35,180
We've found the good clay,
Stepan!

1184
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:38,299
Here is the clay!

1185
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:40,299
l have found the clay, Stepan!

1186
02:41:47,610 --> 02:41:49,309
Andreika! Andreika!

1187
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:55,200
Where are you all?

1188
02:42:06,569 --> 02:42:08,270
Boriska! Boriska!

1189
02:42:09,569 --> 02:42:11,270
-What?
-Shall l dig in?

1190
02:42:11,569 --> 02:42:13,270
l'm coming.

1191
02:42:13,569 --> 02:42:15,270
What are you saying?

1192
02:42:16,579 --> 02:42:18,280
l'm coming!

1193
02:42:18,579 --> 02:42:20,280
Where's Nikolai?

1194
02:42:20,579 --> 02:42:22,280
He left this morning
to fetch wood.

1195
02:42:22,579 --> 02:42:24,280
-lt should be here already.
-He'll be back by evening.

1196
02:42:24,579 --> 02:42:27,159
The evening? l need to
reinforce it now.

1197
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:33,170
To the devil with your Nikolai,
he's an idiot.

1198
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:44,059
Why are you standing there?
Work!

1199
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:46,299
-The merchants don't agree.
-What do you mean?

1200
02:42:46,610 --> 02:42:48,309
They have tripled the price.

1201
02:42:48,610 --> 02:42:49,430
They say it's still cheap.

1202
02:42:49,610 --> 02:42:50,430
But it. What else can we do?

1203
02:42:50,610 --> 02:42:51,430
But it at this price?

1204
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:51,430
Buy, l say!

1205
02:42:55,579 --> 02:42:57,250
The Prince will flay you.
We'll ruin him.

1206
02:42:59,549 --> 02:43:02,129
l no longer care. Buy it.

1207
02:43:04,559 --> 02:43:06,260
You're in the way, Father.
It's dangerous.

1208
02:43:10,559 --> 02:43:13,139
Don't dig in without me.

1209
02:43:13,569 --> 02:43:17,909
-Boriska!
-Just one moment.

1210
02:43:18,569 --> 02:43:21,149
The cast won't hold; it needs
another layer.

1211
02:43:21,569 --> 02:43:24,149
Another layer? You should have
applied the clay already.

1212
02:43:24,579 --> 02:43:26,280
You haven't put up the frame yet!

1213
02:43:27,579 --> 02:43:31,920
lt needs reinforcing, but there
are no more twigs.

1214
02:43:32,579 --> 02:43:34,280
We're not going to reinforce it.
We start firing tonight.

1215
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:37,170
ls he kidding?

1216
02:43:37,590 --> 02:43:39,290
,
If we don't reinforce the cast
it won't hold.

1217
02:43:39,590 --> 02:43:41,290
lt will crack and our work
will be wasted.

1218
02:43:41,590 --> 02:43:43,290
,
If it with snows and we can't fire
won't our work be wasted, too?

1219
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:45,299
They'll flog me, not you.

1220
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:47,299
The cast won't hold like this.

1221
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:49,299
Apply the clay.

1222
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:53,299
Do you hear me?

1223
02:43:54,610 --> 02:43:56,250
l won't do it.

1224
02:43:57,540 --> 02:44:01,879
You won't Then get out!
Andreika, apply the clay.

1225
02:44:02,549 --> 02:44:04,250
He won't do it, either.

1226
02:44:05,549 --> 02:44:07,250
Are you going to apply the clay?

1227
02:44:07,549 --> 02:44:09,250
The metal will burst the mold.

1228
02:44:09,549 --> 02:44:11,250
lt needs reinforcement.

1229
02:44:11,559 --> 02:44:15,020
Will you obey me? Who is in
charge here?

1230
02:44:15,559 --> 02:44:17,260
lt needs reinforcement.

1231
02:44:18,559 --> 02:44:20,260
Fyodor!

1232
02:44:21,569 --> 02:44:23,270
Fyodor!

1233
02:44:24,569 --> 02:44:28,030
Flog him! He refuses to work.

1234
02:44:28,569 --> 02:44:32,030
He won't obey my orders.

1235
02:44:32,579 --> 02:44:36,040
l'll show you who's in charge!

1236
02:44:36,579 --> 02:44:39,159
Your father treated us better.

1237
02:44:39,579 --> 02:44:43,920
You remember him? Then flog him
in my father's name.

1238
02:44:44,590 --> 02:44:47,170
All right, apply the clay.

1239
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:56,120
Start the work without me.

1240
02:44:56,540 --> 02:44:58,239
But we're waiting for you.

1241
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:00,239
Start without me.

1242
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:06,120
Rest, sleep a little.

1243
02:45:13,549 --> 02:45:16,129
Why are you staring at me?

1244
02:45:22,559 --> 02:45:26,020
Lost your tongue? Are you deaf?

1245
02:45:35,569 --> 02:45:37,270
Are you sorry for him?

1246
02:45:42,579 --> 02:45:46,920
Go and console him; that's
what a monk is for.

1247
02:45:52,590 --> 02:45:55,170
O Lord. O Queen of Heaven...

1248
02:46:59,590 --> 02:47:06,559
l can't understand how the Grand
Prince trusted him with all this.

1249
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:19,309
Boriska! Wake up!

1250
02:47:22,610 --> 02:47:24,309
l've started the firing.

1251
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:27,319
Why did you start without me?

1252
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:31,079
l told you to wake me.

1253
02:47:36,629 --> 02:47:39,209
Only know when to start.

1254
02:47:39,629 --> 02:47:43,969
Fyodor, the Prince's men have come,
and they want to see you.

1255
02:47:54,649 --> 02:47:56,290
What heat!

1256
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:05,290
What heat!

1257
02:48:25,610 --> 02:48:27,309
That's enough.

1258
02:48:35,620 --> 02:48:40,840
Not enough sliver; tell the Prince
not be so miserly.

1259
02:48:41,629 --> 02:48:43,329
Out Grand Prince is
never miserly.

1260
02:48:43,629 --> 02:48:46,209
l don't care. l need another
eighteen pounds of sliver.

1261
02:48:46,629 --> 02:48:49,209
What's eighteen pounds of sliver,
more or less?

1262
02:48:49,629 --> 02:48:52,209
Who knows the secret of
bell-casting, l or you?

1263
02:48:52,639 --> 02:48:52,209
Tell the Prince not to be
miserly. We need...

1264
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:57,280
another sixteen pounds.

1265
02:48:57,579 --> 02:48:59,280
Are you mad?

1266
02:48:59,579 --> 02:49:02,159
l'll get all the silver l want
from the Prince.

1267
02:49:06,590 --> 02:49:09,170
lmagine, if after this it
doesn't ring!

1268
02:49:14,590 --> 02:49:16,290
Watch out.

1269
02:49:33,610 --> 02:49:35,309
l recognize him!

1270
02:49:35,610 --> 02:49:37,309
Beat him! Beat him!

1271
02:49:42,620 --> 02:49:46,079
Are you mad? To attack
someone like that.

1272
02:49:47,629 --> 02:49:50,209
You've mistaken him for another.

1273
02:49:50,629 --> 02:49:54,090
l'm not mistaken. l recognize
you, Judas.

1274
02:49:54,629 --> 02:49:58,030
How handsome he used to be then.
Now he has lost his looks.

1275
02:49:58,569 --> 02:50:02,909
Thanks to him, l spent ten
years in prison...

1276
02:50:03,579 --> 02:50:06,159
and they cut off half my tongue.

1277
02:50:08,579 --> 02:50:10,280
l'll kill him!

1278
02:50:17,590 --> 02:50:19,290
l'll kill him!

1279
02:50:19,590 --> 02:50:21,290
l'll kill him!

1280
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:32,059
He's innocent, brother. He's
betrayed no one.

1281
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:36,059
l swear by the Holy Cross. Lord,
why this punishment?

1282
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:44,190
Strike me, but don't touch him.

1283
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:47,319
Get up.

1284
02:50:54,629 --> 02:50:56,270
You're heavy.

1285
02:50:59,559 --> 02:51:02,139
The Prince's jester died.

1286
02:51:02,569 --> 02:51:06,909
They wanted me to go, but l'd
rather be a carpenter.

1287
02:51:09,569 --> 02:51:12,149
l recognize him.

1288
02:51:15,579 --> 02:51:17,280
He denounced me.

1289
02:51:19,579 --> 02:51:21,280
Give me something to drink.

1290
02:51:49,610 --> 02:51:52,190
There are worse things than that.

1291
02:52:07,569 --> 02:52:10,149
Andreika, stand aside.

1292
02:52:21,579 --> 02:52:24,159
Why stand there? Work!

1293
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:32,409
OO Add some more,...

1294
02:52:32,590 --> 02:52:34,290
add some more!

1295
02:52:34,590 --> 02:52:36,290
Come on!

1296
02:52:36,590 --> 02:52:38,290
Boriska, where is he?

1297
02:53:03,559 --> 02:53:06,139
Boriska, the second
furnace is ready.

1298
02:53:12,559 --> 02:53:15,139
Go, go! We're all ready.

1299
02:53:22,569 --> 02:53:23,389
Open!

1300
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:48,180
Everything is ready.
Shall we begin?

1301
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:50,420
Come on!

1302
02:54:01,549 --> 02:54:05,889
lt's coming, Boriska! It's coming!
It's coming.

1303
02:54:12,559 --> 02:54:14,260
God, help me.

1304
02:57:58,579 --> 02:58:01,159
What a day tomorrow will be!

1305
02:58:04,590 --> 02:58:06,290
We should get some sleep.

1306
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:19,180
Boriska! Let's go, shall we?

1307
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:21,299
Just a moment.

1308
02:59:11,590 --> 02:59:14,170
This is what happened, Andrei.

1309
02:59:19,600 --> 02:59:22,180
l've thought it over and l've
decided to tell you.

1310
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:29,059
You know how much l envied.
Envy just gnawed at me.

1311
02:59:30,610 --> 02:59:33,190
lt was inside me like a poison.

1312
02:59:33,610 --> 02:59:37,950
l couldn't stand it any longer,
that's why l left.

1313
02:59:38,620 --> 02:59:42,079
l left because of you.

1314
02:59:42,620 --> 02:59:46,079
When l heard you had given up
painting, the envy went.

1315
02:59:46,620 --> 02:59:49,200
My heart grew lighter.
Then l forgot.

1316
02:59:50,629 --> 02:59:52,329
l only want to copy the
Scriptures before l die.

1317
02:59:52,629 --> 02:59:56,030
The Father Superior is strict...

1318
02:59:56,569 --> 02:59:59,149
and his punishment is not easy
in my old age.

1319
02:59:59,569 --> 03:00:02,149
l'm afraid l won't have enough
time to finish my task.

1320
03:00:02,569 --> 03:00:05,149
Why am l repenting? Why should
l repent to you?

1321
03:00:05,579 --> 03:00:07,280
You yourself are a greater
sinner than l.

1322
03:00:07,579 --> 03:00:11,040
Yes, yes, greater than l.

1323
03:00:11,579 --> 03:00:13,280
What am l? A humble worm;
nothing is demanded of me.

1324
03:00:13,579 --> 03:00:15,280
But you, what are you?

1325
03:00:15,590 --> 03:00:18,170
For what sacred deed did God
give you your talent?

1326
03:00:18,590 --> 03:00:21,170
Lord, l don't want to say this.

1327
03:00:21,590 --> 03:00:24,170
l know Nikon has sent a third
messenger to you...

1328
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:27,180
to persuade you to come back
to paint the Trinity.

1329
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:29,299
And you sent them all back. You
wouldn't even talk to them.

1330
03:00:29,600 --> 03:00:32,180
l'll tell you the truth. l won't lie.

1331
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:36,059
Then, in my dirty soul, there,
in the very depth of it...

1332
03:00:36,610 --> 03:00:39,190
there was a tiny flicker of joy.

1333
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:41,309
And now...

1334
03:00:43,610 --> 03:00:47,069
my life is ending; my soul
calls out for rest.

1335
03:00:48,620 --> 03:00:51,200
Nikon doesn't care a bit
for you life.

1336
03:00:51,620 --> 03:00:51,200
He wants you here, to glorify and
strengthen his power with your talent.

1337
03:00:55,590 --> 03:00:58,139
Never mind Nikon, but
listen to me.

1338
03:00:59,559 --> 03:01:03,020
Go to the Trinity cathedral and
paint, paint, paint!

1339
03:01:03,569 --> 03:01:07,909
Don't burden your soul, for it is an
awful sin to deny the divine spark.

1340
03:01:09,569 --> 03:01:13,030
lf Theophanes were alive, wouldn't
he say the same thing?

1341
03:01:15,579 --> 03:01:19,040
Look at me, look at the ungifted one.
Why do you think l returned?

1342
03:01:19,579 --> 03:01:23,920
For a crust of bread, to finish my
life in peace.

1343
03:01:24,590 --> 03:01:28,049
l shall die soon and nothing will
remain after me.

1344
03:01:28,590 --> 03:01:31,170
And l know that l will die soon.

1345
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:35,059
Nor have you much longer to live.

1346
03:01:36,600 --> 03:01:40,059
Do you want to take your
talent to the grave?

1347
03:01:41,610 --> 03:01:45,069
Why are you silent, Andrei? Give
me at me at least one word.

1348
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:48,190
lt was l who denounced
that jester then.

1349
03:01:48,610 --> 03:01:51,190
Curse me, but don't stay
silent, Andrei.

1350
03:01:53,620 --> 03:01:55,319
Curse me.

1351
03:04:10,750 --> 03:04:12,450
Well, how is it?

1352
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:16,459
Come on, then.

1353
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:21,459
Everyone, get away!

1354
03:04:27,770 --> 03:04:30,350
What's going on up there?

1355
03:04:30,770 --> 03:04:32,469
Everything is okay.

1356
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:34,479
Come on, come on!
Everyone go up!

1357
03:04:40,780 --> 03:04:41,600
Well? Come on.

1358
03:05:05,809 --> 03:05:08,389
Go on. Give the signal.

1359
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:23,459
Come on!

1360
03:07:11,799 --> 03:07:16,139
The Grand Prince is coming with
a foreign ambassador.

1361
03:07:16,809 --> 03:07:18,450
ls everything ready?

1362
03:07:19,739 --> 03:07:21,440
lf not, watch out!

1363
03:07:21,750 --> 03:07:23,450
Motherfucker!

1364
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:44,100
We bless and consecrate this
bell with holy water.

1365
03:08:44,760 --> 03:08:48,219
ln the name of the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost. Amen.

1366
03:09:38,750 --> 03:09:41,329
Look what kind of people are
overseeing here.

1367
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:51,459
Where are you going?

1368
03:09:58,770 --> 03:10:00,469
lsn't rather peculiar?

1369
03:10:00,770 --> 03:10:03,350
They're all peculiar here.

1370
03:10:15,790 --> 03:10:18,309
Come on, come on, dumbbell!

1371
03:10:34,739 --> 03:10:37,319
Shall l help you, or will you
touch it yourself?

1372
03:11:04,770 --> 03:11:07,350
What do you think will come out
of all this travesty?

1373
03:11:07,770 --> 03:11:09,469
What do you think?

1374
03:11:09,770 --> 03:11:12,350
ln my opinion, nothing good
will come out of this.

1375
03:11:12,780 --> 03:11:15,360
Excuse me, Your Excellency,
but l think you are...

1376
03:11:15,780 --> 03:11:17,479
being deceived by appearances.

1377
03:11:18,719 --> 03:11:20,420
Look at all of this!

1378
03:11:20,719 --> 03:11:24,180
What do you think of this dumb
bell, this awkward scaffold?

1379
03:11:24,719 --> 03:11:27,299
l would sum it up and say this
bell will not ring.

1380
03:11:27,719 --> 03:11:29,420
ln fact, it can't ring.

1381
03:11:29,729 --> 03:11:32,309
Does Your Excellency wish
to make a wager?

1382
03:11:32,729 --> 03:11:34,430
l think you underestimate
the situation these...

1383
03:11:34,729 --> 03:11:36,430
people are in.

1384
03:11:36,729 --> 03:11:39,309
Besides, they were the
ones that built it.

1385
03:11:39,739 --> 03:11:44,079
That may be true, but l wouldn't
venture to call that thing a bell.

1386
03:11:44,739 --> 03:11:47,319
Excellency, they fully
understand...

1387
03:11:47,739 --> 03:11:52,079
That the Prince will behead them
if it doesn't ring.

1388
03:11:52,750 --> 03:11:56,209
Judging from the face
of that youth...

1389
03:11:56,750 --> 03:11:59,329
one could say that he is aware
of the circumstances.

1390
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:01,459
Don't you think so?

1391
03:12:02,760 --> 03:12:04,459
Excellency...

1392
03:12:04,760 --> 03:12:09,100
Have you heard that the Grand
Prince beheaded his brother?

1393
03:12:09,770 --> 03:12:11,469
lt seems they were twins.

1394
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:15,229
Look at that marvelous girl!
My God!

1395
03:12:15,770 --> 03:12:19,170
My friend, that girl is not more
than thirteen years old.

1396
03:12:20,709 --> 03:12:23,290
That doesn't make her
Iess attractive.

1397
03:12:23,709 --> 03:12:27,170
Sometimes these girls are
women at the thirteen.

1398
03:12:27,719 --> 03:12:30,299
What's the matter with you,
Your Excellency?

1399
03:15:02,809 --> 03:15:04,510
Come on, come on.

1400
03:15:06,809 --> 03:15:10,270
My father, that old snake, didn't
pass on the secret.

1401
03:15:10,809 --> 03:15:10,270
He died without telling me, he took
it to the grave. Skinflint scoundrel!

1402
03:15:17,790 --> 03:15:19,459
You see, it's turned
out very well.

1403
03:15:19,760 --> 03:15:21,459
Come on, come on.

1404
03:15:22,760 --> 03:15:26,219
Let's go together, you and l.

1405
03:15:27,760 --> 03:15:31,219
You'll cast bells.
l'll paint icons.

1406
03:15:33,770 --> 03:15:36,350
We'll go to the Trinity
Monastery together.

1407
03:15:36,770 --> 03:15:38,469
What a feast day for
the people.

1408
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:42,239
You've brought them such joy,
and you're crying.

1409
03:15:45,780 --> 03:15:48,360
Come on, come on.

1410
03:16:00,780 --> 03:16:07,360
